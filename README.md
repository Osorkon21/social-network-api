# Social Network API

## Description

The social network API - built with Mongoose - is now operational! API calls allow you to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE Users and Thoughts.

## Installation

Node.js is required. Clone this repo and navigate to the root folder on your console. Enter ```npm i``` to install the necessary node packages.

## Usage

As this application is not deployed, it can only be used locally. Navigate to the root folder of the project on your console. Enter ```node server.js``` to start the server. Sample requests using Insomnia are available in the walkthrough video.
